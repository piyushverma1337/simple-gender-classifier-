# simple-gender-classifier
very basic gender classifier based on DecisonTreeClassifier in sklearn trained using data including height, weight and shoe size.

Script accepts user input for the above variables and outputs the predicted gender.

Added second script that visualizes the tree using Graphviz, either on IPython notebook or output to a file.
